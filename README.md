## Objectives
The goal of this project is to improve the in-house call management centre of a major travel company.

### Problem
The problem is that the current system makes it difficult for Relationship Managers to efficiently and effectively help customers purchase a travel company. This is due to long wait times for customers and RM's not understanding the customers intentions quickly enough, making the whole process slow and cumbersome.

## Design Thinking Principles Perspective
Empathy Maps

Three POV Statements
1. "I am a Customer trying to purchase a travel package, but i'm frustrated with the service i am receiving from the Travel Company as the wait times are long and they dont understand my intentions well. This makes me feel irritated and impatient" 
2. "I am a Relation Manager trying to better serve my customers. Whenever i get connected, their initial attitude is always negative due to long wait times. I sometimes forget what the optimal travel package for them is, since i have to deal with so many different customers. This makes me frustrated."
3. "I am a Travel Company trying to improve the in-house call management centre, but it is too difficult for our employees to help customers purchase a travel package due to long wait times and misunderstanding the customer's intentions. This makes me feel anxious and frustrated."

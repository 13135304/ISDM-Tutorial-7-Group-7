## Executive Summary
This report examines the problems surrounding the operations of a call management centre and recommend methods of increasing its efficiency and effectiveness.

The research showcases that the current system operation is complicated due to the number and nature of the holiday packages. Furthermore, wait times for customers are too long, making the relationship between them and the employee tarnished before the call begins. After the customer connects with a Relationship Manager, they dont have enough information about the customer, making the process and call rate slow and inefficient. These factors are the major causes to why the current system operation has problems.

The travel company is aiming to circumvent these issues by developing a new information system that improves the overall operations of the call management system. The report concludes that it would be ideal to satisfy its existing customer base while also attracting new potential customers due to the efficient and effective new information system.

## Project Objectives
The goal of this project is to improve the in-house call management centre of a major travel company.

## Problem Definition
We want our relationship managers to efficiently and effectively help customers purchase a travel package through our in-house call management centre.

However, the current operational system makes it difficult for relationship managers to sell due to long wait times, and RM's not understanding the customers intentions fast enough. If we ignore this problem, we could potentially lose customers to competing companies, lose revenue and damage our overall quality and company reputation.

To fix this issue, we will adopt a design thinking and scrum methodology to truly understand out customers and iteratively improve our operational system.

## Stakeholders
1. Inbound calling customers
2. Outbound called customers
3. Relationship Manager
4. Travel Company
5. Call management centre
6. Competing travel company's
7. Call centre manager

**POV Statements**
1. "I am an inbound calling customer trying to purchase a travel package, but I'm frustrated with the service I am receiving from the Travel Company as the wait times are long and they don't understand my intentions well. This makes me feel irritated and impatient."
2. "I am an outbound called customer trying to enjoy my day, but it is annoying to receive calls from a company asking to purchase their products as i need to do research, sort my schedule and need more time before i can make a purchasing decision. This makes me feel displeased and frustrated."
3. "I am a Relation Manager trying to better serve my customers. Whenever I get connected, their initial attitude is always negative due to long wait times. I sometimes forget what the optimal travel package for them is, since I have to deal with so many different customers. This makes me frustrated."
4. "We are a Travel Company trying to improve the in-house call management centre, but it is too difficult for our employees to help customers purchase a travel package due to long wait times and misunderstanding the customer's intentions. This makes me feel anxious and aggravated."

**Reflection**

Due to the current situation surrounding the virus, there are various issues surrounding the case study during Design Thinking. We had a group discussion surrounding the issues and how we would overcome them. This includes reduced face-to-face communication, unable to interview real actors, and gain real-world data. We overcame this through the internet and utilising different social networking software, and assumptions on the case study and using design thinking methodology to understand the major stakeholders of the case. This allowed us to successfully progress through the project, despite the external factors.

After this we started assigning different roles to each group member to ensure that we complete this project within the alloted time frame. We broke down the roles based on every group members strengths and weaknesses. 

Our Design Thinking methodology started with a brainstorm of different stakeholders relating to the case study. We originally decided to use the customer, relation manager and travel company for our empathy maps as they were the major stakeholders surrounding the case study. However, with further consultation with the tutor, we split the customer into two and utilised inbound called customer, outbound calling customers and the relationship manager for our empathy maps as they posed more in-depth discussion and analysis.

Next, we created our empathy maps for our major stakeholders on Lucidchart. Using Lucidchart was difficult at first as we needed a premium membership to fully utilise all of its features. We overcame this by connecting our accounts to our school email allowing us access to the premium membership. Lucidchart was helpful as we could all collaborate online in real-time which made it efficient and effective.

With the POV statements, it was found that every stakeholder involved is affected by the current operation of the call management centre. It was more difficult for employees to do their job and drove customers away to competing company's primarily due to the long wait times and misunderstanding between RM and customer.

After creating the POV statements, there are various external factors that halted the steady progress of the project from all the group members. This involved external assessments from other subjects which took up time and productivity from the progression of the project. We overcame this by identifying the issue and decided as a group to dedicate some time each week to this project to ensure its progression towards the due date.

With the creation of the POV statements, we started work on the How Might We questions relating to the project. The POV statements helped shape the scope of our questions. This is relayed below:
1. How might we improve the relationship between the customer and RM?
2. How might we improve the customer's experience while they're calling?
3. How might we speed up the call rate for RM's?
4. How might we increase the RM's performance and product knowledge?
5. How might we recommend better purchase options for our customers?

This formed the basis of our design thinking methodology for the project. Following all these steps allowed us to get a better understanding of the final project and empathise with whom we are designing the project for. After the design thinking stage, we arranged another group meeting to discuss our thoughts and move on to the next stage which was the agile methodology. In this stage, we utilised a Scrum agile method to progress through the various diagrams and models.

**Assumptions**

* RM's are frustrated with the long wait times like the customers
* RM's don't understand their customers well as they calls are being sent to RM's randomly
* The travel company doesn't have an online website for customers to find holiday and travel packages
* Customers create their customer profile by utilisng the Profiler Tool
* RM's wont be able to see their own profiles to keep morale up
* The new system wont slow down the call operations as customers with customer profiles will be prioritised over customers without one
* Outbound called customers are not current customers for the Travel Company
* The company is losing revenue and market share due to competitors, which is why they want to develop a new information system


## Agile Methodology
An appropriate system development methodology will need to be utilised in order to plan, structure and control the development of the new information system.

In agile methodology, various parts of the system are worked on concurrently, as opposed to the sequential order of activities in traditional waterfall methodology. Projects are developed in iterations and stages, with constant testing, review and feedback with stakeholders, providing continuous improvement with each iteration. Less emphasis is held on documentation, and instead there is a focus on communication, collaboration and adaptation. This efficiency and flexibility of agile development enables any changes, including requirements, to be implemented at any stage of development.


### SCRUM
A Scrum is an agile process that allows us to focus on delivering business value in shortest times. We utilised a Scrum process due to its ability to efficiently complete a project by working collaboratively as a group. This is demonstrated through the Scrum team model which is self-organising and cross-functional. We split ourselves as a group into teams to work on the models involving planning, designing, testing and documentation. 

The Scrum events we used were the sprint retrospective and the scrum cycle. This is because these two events suited our timelines well as we didnt have enough time to meet daily due to other commitments. The Sprint Retrospective allowed us to look back at our backlog and timeline of commits to identify current issues and determine methods in further improving the project. The Scrum Cycle allowed us to incrementally work on the project and help us prioritise the most important methods needed to complete the project. This involved utilising the Sprint backlog as a basis to start the Scrum and ensuring that we assign tasks to specific members of the group and progression on the project. After that we would hold a weekly Scrum meeting every Friday to determine the outcome of our tasks and allow us to incrementally complete the project within the given deadline.

We employed a variety of scrum artefacts including the product backlog, user stories and a sprint backlog. The product backlog is represented below which showcases an ordered list that needs to be completed in the project. It consists of user stories and their priorities. The Sprint backlog showcases our timeline of progression for the project and the various issues we encountered. It represents a plan for delivering the product increments and consists of work flow stages and individual work items. Our one is showcased through a Kanban board located on Github.

**Use Case Model**

The use case model was started by utilising the user stories. Similar to the Empathy maps, we will be using Lucidchart to collaborate online and complete the use case model. Initially, we experienced issues as we were confused on how to create the the use case models since there are many versions that can be created. We decided to create two use case models showcasing the current call management system and another one for the proposed system that is going to be developed. 

* Current System
<img src="EmpathyMaps/CurrentSystemUseCase.png" width = "100%">

* Propose System
<img src="EmpathyMaps/ProposedSystemUseCase.png" width = "100%">

After some discussions with the tutor, we decided to use his feedback and create one whole use case diagram containing both the current and proposed system. However, we will distinguish them by colour coding the proposed system. This will give a better comparison and view on how the proposed system will help the call management system as a single glance will clearly showcase the imporvements that the proposed system will make.

**Activity Diagram**

We experienced some trouble with the Activity diagram as we werent sure how specific or brief we needed to be. Furthermore, we werent sure whether to model the current system or the proposed system However we opted to make the activity diagrams succinct and easy to read without compromisng the amount of information. We created two separate activity diagrams that detail the series of events that inbound calling customers and outbound called customers will go through on the proposed system.

However after creating the diagrams, we planned a group discussion later in the week where further edits will be made to the activity diagram to help finalise it.
